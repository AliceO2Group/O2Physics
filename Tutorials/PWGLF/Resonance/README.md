# This is the base for the PWGLF tutorials for the O2AT

The tutorial (6-10 Nov 2023) can be still used and is a reference for the LF analyses.
It is built as a set of steps. Each step adds a level of complexity and is built in a separate executable.
The executables are defined in the `CMakeLists.txt`.

## Files
* `README.md` this readme
* `CMakeLists.txt` here are defined the source files to compile
* `resonance_step0.cxx` Read the resonance table and run basic track loop
